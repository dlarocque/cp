Competion times
Q1: 8m
Q2: N/A
Q3: 27m
Q4: N/A

Q1: Simple enough, just a math idea
Q2: Again, math idea BUT I'm an idiot and tried to get to an optimal solution before even solving (BF works)
 > Check constraints
Q3: Again, more of a math trick; increasing the smallest number always yields a higher result
